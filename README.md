# northrise.co.zm

This is a simple "starter" site, built for a newly created domain so that it's not just altogether bare / void.

The idea is to have just the bare essentials (for now):

    - entity name (and logo if available)
    - a single sentence describing what you do / services you offer
    - physical address
    - how people can contact you (phone, email, etc.)
